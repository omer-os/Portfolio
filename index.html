        Over the course of its release I have attended its first hackathon and

        and with other developers to create apps for the system to help it gain

        This was a program designed to create mind maps, it could have nodes
        made, and linked, have images added and included a pen tool to allow the
        user to draw notes on top of the mind maps. It also had a fully
        functional undo and redo system and the ability to save and load files.
