            <h2>What it is</h2>
            A tower defence game, mostly created over the course of 1-2 months. Players can place cats to attack balls of wool rolling along a path. Cats can be upgraded with different upgrade paths and can be deleted to allow 
            for a partial refund. The tower system was designed to be easily expanded and altered along with a rudimentary map file system that allowed users to add maps of their own design. Although a functional prototype was 
            created, no artist was ever found to allow for a proper art pass or visual redesign so the project never left this first phase.

            <h2>What I did</h2>
            Almost all of the project was a team effort with I and my friend sharing ideas and working on the same code in a pair, swapping and working off each others ideas. I proposed alot of the original logic behind the movement 
            systems, the level select menu and the file structure for custom maps along with alot of the smaller features such as tower placement and selection. These proposals were built off by both myself and my partner as the system 
            evolved in complexity and scale.
